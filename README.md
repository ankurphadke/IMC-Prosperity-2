# IMC-Prosperity-2
## Submissions
I played around with the round 1 algo trading question and made a couple basic submissions. I soon realized that it is much more time-consuming than I initially expected and didn't get enough time to work on it more seriously. I will be proceeding with the manual component of the competition only.

Overall, seems like a cool competition though. Requires each iteration to compute a value estimation for each product, and then act based on the estimate. Allows the model to store state between iterations. This reminds me of repeated RPS from CS 486. I'm interested to see what rounds 2-5 add on to the algo part of the competition. Reinforcement learning seem like the concept they're going after at a high level. I should definitely try and take this more seriously next year.

Through exploring this process, I came across a few GitHub repositories with open source tools that help in the development process. The author (https://github.com/jmerle) has built some elaborate tools to help with this competition. His work inspired me to soend more time pursuing software development outside of work. Building static webpages, end-to-end applications, contributing to open source software, etc. There are so many avenues for learning while contributing real, shippable code. I should make use of these opportunities.
